#### 0.3.1-0 (18 September 2015)
* Glance footer is implemented.  Vignettes need to be updated
* Variable labels and levels are implemented (well ahead of
  schedule!).  Vignettes need to be updated

#### 0.3.0-0 (15 September 2015)
* Multi-cell output for HTML is fully supported.
* Data frame row names may be captured in the output with `dust` 
  argument `keep_rownames`
* A new sprinkle is added.  `na_string` defaults to "", and controls how
  `NA` is printed in tables.

#### 0.2.0-1 (31 August 2015)
* Multi-cell output is functional for HTML, Markdown, and Console output
* A poor example is added to the `advancedMagic` vignette, but a better
  example is really needed.

#### 0.1.1-7 (17 August 2015)
* Finished the Advanced Magic vignette, which serves as the tests for advanced
  output since I haven't bothered to code a way to check the results directly.
* Configure the repository for coveralls.
* Adds `covr` and `Hmisc` to Suggests:

#### 0.1.1-6 (12 August 2015)
* Removed 'longtable' option from `print.dust` and made it a sprinkle. This
  allows it to be used without having to explicitly call `print`.
* Implemented longtable capacity.  Users may now break tables into multiple
  divisions of either a default size (25 rows for console, markdown, or HTML)
  or a user-specified number of rows.
* Began an "advanced magic" vignette to demonstrate the capabilities of 
  longtable and eventually multicolumn and multirow support.  Similar 
  vignettes will be needed for console, markdown, and html output, though
  not all of them will need to be bundled with the package.
* Added the `roundSafe` helper function to allow rounding to succeed while
  skipping true character values.

#### 0.1.1-5 (11 August 2015)
* Added the `longtable` option to `print.dust`.  Not yet active, but lays
  the groundwork for multipage tables.
* Added multirow headers and footers (but not interfoot)
* Added the `redust` function for adding and/or switching table components.  For
  example, adding a multirow header, or a foot.

#### 0.1.1-4 (5 August 2015)
* Added the `replace` sprinkle to replace values in table columns, rows, or cells.
  This closes Issue #12

#### 0.1.1-3 (4 August 2015)
* Optimizations related to removing ifelse calls.  
* Initial values for table attributes are now stored as "" instead of NA.
  This increases the object size, but cuts down on the processing time.
* Removed `object` element from the `dust` object. In Issue #13, matthieugomez
  pointed out that very large models could create storage space problems. 
  There's no sense in keeping an extra copy of the model object.
* Removed the `+.dust` method and rewrote the sprinkles as pipable functions.
  This resolves Issue #8

#### 0.1.1 (3 August 2015)
* Added the necessary fields to DESCRIPTION to get the vignettes to build.

#### 0.1.0 (1 August 2015)
* CRAN checks are passed.  Prepared for release.

#### 0.0.0-9 (31 July 2015)
* Finished tests
* Finished vignettes

#### 0.0.0-8 (30 July 2015)
* Finished HTML rendering
* Adds pixiedust vignette
* Removes old vignettes

#### 0.0.0-7 (29 July 2015)
* Replace nearly all dust bunny functions with `sprinkle`
* Replace `dust_print_method` with `sprinkle_print_method`
* Replace `dust_colnames` with `sprinkle_colnames`
* It occurred to me as I studied the code base that instead
  of rows and cols in the ... argument of the dust bunnies, 
  it made more sense to add the dust bunnies in ... with
  formal arguments for row and col.  I also came up 
  with the idea of naming the package `pixiedust` and 
  sprinkling the dust around.  It sounded like fun so 
  let's hope CRAN lets me get away with it.
* All functionality has been rewritten to support the
  pixiedust paradigm, but new tests and vignettes need 
  to be written to confirm that it all works.
* R CMD check has _NOT_ been run.

#### 0.0.0-6 (28 July 2015)
* Adds `dust_rotate_text`

#### 0.0.0-5 (27 July 2015)
* Adds `dust_cell_valign`
* Adds `dust_border_collapse`
* Adds `dust_table_border`
* Adds `dust_cell_border`
* Adds `dust_cell_padding`

#### 0.0.0-4 (26 July 2015)
* Improved the Dustbunnies vignette to use a color coded table indicating which 
  dust bunnies are planned, available, and functional for different printing 
  methods.
* Dropped leading zeroes from the version number.
* Adds `dust_font_color`, `dust_font_size`
* Adds `dust_cell_height`, `dust_cell_width`

#### 0.0.0-003 (25 July 2015)
* Adds halign and valign attributes to `dust$obj`. valign is not yet implemented.
* Adds `dust_cell_halign`
* Adds `dust_head_halign`
* Adds dustbunnies vignette
* Removed the `col_names` attribute of the `dust` object and replaced it with the
  `head` object.  The `head` object is a data frame holding the attributes of the
  table header.
* Renamed the `obj` attributes of the `dust` object to `body`.
* Adds a lot of tests
* Adds `dust_cell_bg` and `dust_bg_pattern`

#### 0.0.0-002 (24 July 2015)
* 'col_names` attribute is now named.  The names are the original 
  column names from the `broom` output.
* Adds `dust_fn`
* Adds `dust_bold`
* Adds `dust_italic`
* Adds `dust_print_format`
* Imports knitr
* Imports `lazyWeave::pvalString`


#### 0.0.0-001 (23 July 2015)
* Adds `dust` and `print.dust`.
* Only the method for printing to the console is available.
* `+.dust` added
* `dust_colnames` added
