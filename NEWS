#### 0.1.1 (3 August 2015)
* Added the necessary fields to DESCRIPTION to get the vignettes to build.

#### 0.1.0 (1 August 2015)
* CRAN checks are passed.  Prepared for release.

#### 0.0.0-9 (31 July 2015)
* Finished tests
* Finished vignettes

#### 0.0.0-8 (30 July 2015)
* Finished HTML rendering
* Adds pixiedust vignette
* Removes old vignettes

#### 0.0.0-7 (29 July 2015)
* Replace nearly all dust bunny functions with `sprinkle`
* Replace `dust_print_method` with `sprinkle_print_method`
* Replace `dust_colnames` with `sprinkle_colnames`
* It occurred to me as I studied the code base that instead
  of rows and cols in the ... argument of the dust bunnies, 
  it made more sense to add the dust bunnies in ... with
  formal arguments for row and col.  I also came up 
  with the idea of naming the package `pixiedust` and 
  sprinkling the dust around.  It sounded like fun so 
  let's hope CRAN lets me get away with it.
* All functionality has been rewritten to support the
  pixiedust paradigm, but new tests and vignettes need 
  to be written to confirm that it all works.
* R CMD check has _NOT_ been run.
